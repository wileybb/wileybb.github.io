            <p id="paragraph">Hey! My name's Wiley. I am just starting out coding. Soon I will have a certificate from a full-stack development course! That will be sweet! I love to play piano, listen to music, garden and play video games in my free time. I went to colege at UC Berkeley and received a bachelors degree in philosophy. I am interested in urban-farming and growing food in cities as a way to restructure the food system. I think this would be a great solution for climate change and other ills affecting our society today. I hope to embark on projects related to this in the future. Currently I have some fruit, vegetables and herbs growing at home, but I really need some fruit trees. labore et dolore magna aliqua.
